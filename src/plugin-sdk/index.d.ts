/**
 * Studio plugin SDK — the typed contract a plugin is written against.
 *
 * Self-contained on purpose: a plugin package is built outside this repository, so nothing here
 * imports from `src/shared` or any other Studio path. `PluginManifest` below is a mirror of
 * `src/shared/plugins.ts`; `tests/conformance/plugin-sdk-types.test.ts` compiles the two against
 * each other in both directions, so a change to one that is not mirrored fails the suite.
 *
 * API 2 is additive over API 1. New manifest sections arrive as further optional fields; nothing
 * documented here is removed.
 *
 * A backend written in JavaScript points its JSDoc at the copy of this file it ships beside:
 * `@type {import('./plugin-sdk/index.d.ts').Activate}` on `export const activate`. One in
 * TypeScript imports `Activate` from the same path. Either way the host-service names, the
 * activation shape and the panel bridge are checked before anyone installs the package.
